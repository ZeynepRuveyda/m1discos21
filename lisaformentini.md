# Hello everyone !
I am Lisa, from France, initally from *south france*, explaining my love for heat and sun. I like open data, and this course is particularly interesting for me because I need to learn how to do dashboards for my start up side project ! 
Do I have any spare time? Between my various projects, my side activities, my research interests in cognitive science, I am quite taken by the time. I guess I'll end by saying that my favorite desert is le *saint-honoré*, typically french.

**Have a great day !**
